Ingress GPS Intel (IGI)
=======================

Script to show players location using any GeoJSON repository

Install
-------

Use the main.js file, and install it on Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome).

TODO
----

1. Implement a basic security between a server and this script.
2. Show a better icon of the players on the map (maybe with a nickname shown all the time).
3. Instead of removing the locations layer, and drawing it again, implement an update system, to add, remove, update people's location, instead of redrawing them all the time.
4. Allow custom fields of player's info.
5. Show player's direction on the map.
6. Do not require use of IITC (Make the script work on ingress Intel official map as well).
